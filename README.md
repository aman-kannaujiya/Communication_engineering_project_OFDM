Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is widely used in modern wireless systems like LTE, 5G, and Wi-Fi due to its high spectral efficiency and robustness against multipath fading. However, Doppler shift caused by user mobility introduces Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI), which degrades system performance.
This project evaluates the effect of Doppler shift on OFDM using different modulation schemes (QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM) under Rayleigh and Rician fading conditions through MATLAB simulations.

Key Finding:

QPSK provides better BER performance in high Doppler environments.

Higher-order modulations (16-QAM, 64-QAM) show more significant performance degradation.
